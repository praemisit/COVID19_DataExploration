* Introduction
Over the first few month in 2020, the Covid-19/Corona virus pandemic has put the entire world into a serious health, social and economic crisis. The first infection was reported in Wuhan, China, on December 1st, 2019. Six weeks later, the first person outside China was tested positively. Since then, the pandemic spread rapidly, and is still spreading rapidly, across all countries. Most countries have closed their borders and shut down their normal societal and economic life. Even though some first countries have started to loosen their restrictions again in late April, the pandemic is expected to keep the entire world more than busy over the next couple of months and years.

So the Corona pandemic is omnipresent all over the world and many people are working hard to better understand 
1) How quickly the virus spreads across countries and societies,
2) What measures might have an impact on the infection and/or death growth rate, and
3) What the major implications of the virus pandemic will be. 

The insights resulting from such analysis could then be used by politicians and other authorities to take decisions, if and how to either loosen or intensify societal and economical restrictions.

*Over the course of this project we will analyze the following aspects:*

1. Which sources of trustful data around the Corona pandemic exists?
2. What kind of data is provided in the various sources and how can it be used to help understand, how fast the virus spreads in a specific country?
3. Are there significant differences between countries in how the pandemic develops? Do these differences justify further research work? 
4. Can the implications of the Corona pandemic be measured by data?

* Part I: Sources of trustful data around the Corona pandemic

In order to understand the development of the pandemic, we need trustworthy data. The data should provide information on the number of new infections and new deaths per country on a daily basis. That kind of data would allow us to understand the growth rate of infections as well as of deaths caused by the Corona virus.

Some countries like [[https://info.gesundheitsministerium.at/][Austria]] or [[https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html][Germany]] do provide official dashboards to publish the number of Corona infections and deaths. For other countries there are different sources with slightly different figures. 

As we want to compare the pandemic development between different countries, it seems advisable to use a central data source which comprise data from all, or at least most countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides daily [[https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/][Situation Reports]] on their website. These situation reports are only available as PDF documents and thus difficult to process.

Another institution that collects and provides data about the Coronavirus desease is the "[[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en][European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]]" (ECDC), which is an agency of the European Union. The agency provides [[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide][downloadable data files]], which are updated daily and contain the latest available public data on COVID-19. According to [[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/copyright][ECDC's copyright policy]], the data /may be reproduced, adapted and/or distributed, totally or in part, irrespective of the means and/or the formats used, provided that ECDC is always acknowledged as the original source of the material. Such acknowledgement must be included in each copy of the material./ The ECDC is using the same data to produce a dashboard page called "[[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases][Situation Update Worldwide]]".

The ECDC has published its approach for collecting and processing COVID-19 data on [[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data-collection][this page]]. 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Every day between 6.00 and 10.00 CET, a team of epidemiologists screens up to 500 relevant sources to collect the latest figures. The data screening is followed by ECDC's standard epidemic intelligence process for which every single data entry is validated and documented in an ECDC database. An extract of this database, complete with up-to-date figures and data visualisations, is then shared on the ECDC website, ensuring a maximum level of transparency.
#+END_QUOTE 

The collection and processing approach of the ECDC as well as its copyright policy seems to be appropriate for the intended data analysis. Thus we will use the ECDC data set over the course of this project.

* Part II: Analysis of the provided data and how it can be used to help understand the dynamics of the pandemic
** Data contained in the daily updated and downloadable ECDC data set
The ECDC dataset can be downloaded as CSV file. Over the course of the project, I used datasets from different days. The final results are based on the data from April 29th. A first outline does show that the dataset contains 11 columns.

*** Statistics of the data set

[[./images/Fig02_DataStatistics.png]]


Overall, the raw dataset contains 13623 rows from 207 distinct countries. The earliest reporting is 31st of January 2019. The number of total infections up to April 28th is 2982688 and the number of total deaths is 210193. Based on this data, the current mortality rate is at 7%.


** How fast does the pandamic develop within a specific country?
After having identified a trustful data source about the development of infections and deaths, let's see how this data can be used to help understand how fast the virus spreads within a specific country. For this analysis we will exemplarily focus on Germany.

In the following sub-chapters we will investigate in different KPIs to determine, which KPI, or which combination of KPI's, is the best one to understand the speed of the pandemic spread:

*** 1. Number of new infections and deaths per day 
The number of new infections and new deaths is is directly provided in the ECDC data set. In order to visualize the development, we use a simple bar chart.


**** Number of new infections per day
[[./images/Fig03_Ger_NumberOfInfectionsPerDay.png]]

In Germany, the first infection was reported on January 28th. Based on the current numbers, we might seperate the pandemic currently into 4 phases:
+ Phase 1 (4-5 weeks): The number of new infections per day is quite stable at a very low level.
+ Phase 2 (1-2 weeks): The number of new infections is growing significantly, somehow exploding.
+ Phase 3 (3 weeks): The number of new infections varies per day, but seems to be stable overall at a quite high level.
+ Phase 4 (x weeks): The number of new infections declines slowly.

How the numbers will develop further and whether the trend of declining growth is sustainable, is currently not predictable.

**** Number of new deaths per day
[[./images/Fig04_Ger_NumberOfDeathsPerDay.png]]

In Germany, the first COVID-19 death was reported on March 10th, so around 6 weeks after the pandemic started in the country. So far, the highest number of new deaths was reported on April 16th with 315 deaths, which is approximately 4 weeks after the number of new infections has started to significantly increase.

*** 2. Cumulated number of infections and deaths over time

**** Cumulated number of infections

[[./images/Fig05_Ger_NumberOfInfectionsCum.png]]

As indicated by the bar chart of new infections above, the total number of infections remains relatively stable and low until mid of March, so approximately 5-6 weeks after the pandemic started. After this first phase, we can see a kind of exponential growth of infections for around 1-2 weeks, after which the curve flattens at the end of the reporting period.
**** Cumulated number of death

[[./images/Fig06_Ger_NumberOfDeathsCum.png]]

The cumulated number of deaths follows the number of infections with a few days of delay (approximately a week). 
*** 3. Temporal progressions of new infections and new deaths
The analysis so far does indicate that 
1. The pandemic - expressed by numbers of new infections per day - started slowly in a first phase, exploded somehow in a relatively short second phase, remained stable at a high level for around 3 weeks and then started to decline.
2. The number of deaths follows the number of infections with a certain delay. However, the decline of new death is - so far - not yet proven by the current numbers.

Let's look at this by normalizing each of the two data rows into a range of 0 to 1. That should provide a better visibility on how huge (or small) the increase of new infections / new deaths has been over time relative to the maximum (minimum) of new infections / new deaths.

[[./images/Fig07_Ger_NormalizedNumbers.png]]

The normalized numbers support the indication from above nicely. However, reliable predictions for the further development of new infections / new deaths are not possible based on the given date.
*** 4. Growth Rates and doubling time of new infections and new deaths
"Growth Rate" and "Doubling Time" are further key measure to assess the speed of a pandemic spread. 
**** Growth Rate
The formula for the growth is:

+ p = (TodayCumulatedNumber - YesterdayCumulatedNumber) / YesterdayCumulatedNumber
+ <=> p = DailyNewCases / YesterdayCumulatedNumber
+ <=> p = DailyNewCases / (TodayCumulatedNumber - DailyNewCases)

[[./images/Fig08_Ger_GrowthRates.png]]

The growth rate of infections does nicely illustrate the exponential growth around end of February until mid of March. In this time frame we can see significant daily growth rates. From mid of March onwards, the growth rate for new infections has flattened significantly.

The growth rate of deaths does follow the growth rate of new infections with around 2 weeks delay.
**** Doubling Time
The formula for Doubling Time is: t = Ln(2) / Ln(1+p)

[[./images/Fig09_Ger_DoublingTimes.png]]

The doubling time of new infections was surprisingly stable until mid to end of March. Just by end of March the doubling time started to increase more rapidly and is by now close to 100 days.

The doubling time of new deaths is again following the curve of new infections with around 2 weeks of delay. However, the increase is not yet that significantly.
** Conclusions
The main conclusions out of this second part of the project can be summarized as follows:
1. The publicly available data around the COVID-19 pandemic can be easily used to understand the general dynamics of the pandemic in a single country.
2. At least for Germany, all KPI's from the above sub-chapters indicate that the pandemic development up to know can be structured into 4 phases:
   + *P1 - Warming Up:* The number of new infections per day is at a very low level and stable (4-5 weeks).
   + *P2 - Explosion:* The number of new infections is growing significantly, somehow exploding (1-2 weeks).
   + *P3 - Hot:* The number of new infections varies per day, but seems to be stable overall at a quite high level (3 weeks).
   + *P4 - Cool Down:* The number of new infections declines slowly (x weeks).
3. While all of the KPIs used in this chapter do provide their specific insights, a combination of all does provide the highest value.
* Part III: Analysis of differences in the development of the pandemic between countries
** Intro and Motivation
The COVID-19 pandemic is a world-wide occurrence. And countries are following very different approaches to save lives and not overwhelm healthcare systems. How do these different approach affect the development of the pandemic?


While we have focused on Germany in part II of the project, it makes sense to compare the development of the pandemic between countries in order to 
+ Assess success or failure of the different strategies to cope with the pandemic
+ Identify significant differences as indicator for a root cause analysis
+ Identify common patterns which could help to create more certainty around assumptions about the further development of the pandemic in a specific country.
** Approach
For this analysis we will focus on the following countries:
1. Germany, as we have analyzed Germany already in the chapter before. Germany has reacted quickly to the pandemic, but the measures have not been as restrictive as in Italy or Spain.
2. Italy, as Italy was the first country in Europe with extremely high number of infections and deaths. Italy has reacted not as quickly after the pandemic started in the country, but than put quite restrictive measures in place.
3. USA, as the US is the country with the by far highest number of infections and deaths. The US also reacted rahther late than quickly to the pandemic. The current measure are very different between the various US states.
4. Sweden, as Sweden has taken a very different approach to COVID-19, with significant less restrictive measures than in other countries.
5. UK, as the UK had started with a less restricted approach and then turned to a very rigid approach to tackle COVID-19.

For these 5 countries we will calculate and compare the following KPIs:
+ Development of new infections/deaths in relation to their population size
+ Development of infections/deaths as a percentage of their population size
+ Growth rates and doubling time of new infections/deaths

** KPI 1: Development of new infections/deaths in relation to their population size
*** Purpose and Expectations
This KPI should help us to verify, whether the pandemic develops similar in different countries or whether there are some differences. If there are difference, a further analysis could make sense. This further analysis would then need to identify similarities and differences in the undertaken measures and other conditions which might impact the dynamics of the pandemic.

Based on the observations from part II of this project, in which we have analyzed the development of the pandemic in Germany, and the above briefly outlined different approaches in the five countries, we could assume:
1. A faster and more significant increase in new cases during the "explosion phase" in Italy, the US and the UK compared to Germany.
2. As the measures in the UK and Italy are more restrict compared to Germany, we could assume that the decrease of new infections/deaths is steeper in those countries.
3. As Sweden is still sticking to the more relaxed approach, I would assume that neither the "explosion" phase nor the "cool down" phase is as steep as in the other countries. This would however not explain, why the more relaxed approach is keeping Sweden in a sufficiently acceptable state with regard to COVID-19 infections and deaths.
*** Analysis and Results
**** New infections per day relative to populations size
As the first considerable numbers of relative infections started around February 15, the plot has been restricted to the time frame from Feb 15th to end of April.


[[./images/Fig10_CC_InfectionsPerDay.png]]



Out of this analysis we may derive the subsequent observations. Before, we must make ourselves aware that this analysis was limited to five countries only and that each country might have quite different approaches for COVID-19 testing and reporting. Therefore, while the below conclusions are logically derived from the available data, they are still weak and would need much more analysis before taking final conclusions.
1. Out of the 5 countries, Italy was the one where the pandemic started the earliest. That might explain why it was most difficult for Italy to decide about the appropriate measures as Italy was lacking data from other countries.
2. The significant increase of the pandemic in the other countries started around 2 weeks after Italy. Thus all other 4 countries had at least Italy to learn from.
3. Germany established its "lock-down" measure around mid of March for a period of at least 4 weeks. Even though Germany did face a significant increase of infections in the 2nd half of March, the measures seem to have paid of. The relative number of new infections declined in April and is by now the lowest of the 5 countries.
4. In Sweden, the pandemic grew at the beginning much slower compared to Germany or Italy. That might help to explain why Sweden decided to follow a more relaxed approach. However, as a consequence, the relative number of new infections is not yet declining. As of today the relative numbers are above Germany and around the level of Italy.
5. Similar to Sweden, the pandemic started slower and later in the UK. And at the beginning, also the UK followed a more relaxed approach. However and in contrast to Sweden, the development of the pandemic was much steeper around early April, which forced the UK to change its approach to a more restrictive one. By now, the UK still has 2nd highest new infection rate.
6. Up to mid of March, the COVID-19 pandemic in the US was relatively mild. Over the 2nd half of March the pandemic than increased in a similar way as in Italy. Also the US reacted quite late with mitigation measures and the relative infection rate is still at a comparable high level (highest in the analyzed country group).
**** New COVID-19 deaths per day relative to populations size
[[./images/Fig11_CC_DeathsPerDay.png]]
The analysis of the relative number of deaths caused by COVID-19 does provide some additional interesting observations:
1. Compared to the other countries, the relative number of new deaths per day in Germany is the lowest over the entire time-frame. Whether that is due to a "better" healthcare system or other conditions cannot be derived out of the available data.
2. Within the 5 countries, Italy was the one where the deadly impact of the pandemic started the earliest. That might explain why Italy than had to put in place very rigid restriction measures. 
3. Compared to Germany, the development of deaths in all of the three other countries (US, UK and Sweden) was steeper, and is still at a significantly higher level. The rather late, or less restrictive measures in these countries might have ultimately also led to a higher relative number of COVID-19 deaths.
4. The relative death rate in Sweden is comparable high and does currently not indicate to decline. That may increase the pressure on Swedish authorities to adjust their current quite relaxed approach.
*** Conclusions
In our analysis we have been able to observe that the pandemic develops quite differently in countries with different strategies to tackle COVID-19. A fast and consequent reaction with restrictive measures seems to have a positive influence on limiting the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths. 

Approaches with a more relaxed reaction have not paid out in some countries. The data proves that the development of infections / deaths in the UK as well as the US was significantly higher compared to Germany. That might have forced those countries to change their approaches.

Sweden is the country in our analysis which still pursues a more relaxed strategy. Based on the available data, the relative number of infections and deaths stabilized on a comparable high level and so far the numbers are not declining as in the other countries. Depending on the further development, Sweden might get under pressure to change their strategy.

*Overall:* 

The development of the pandemic differs significantly between the countries. Why these differences exist cannot be fully analyzed in this project, but is definitely worth further research. 

We also have not looked into the impacts that the different country strategies and measures have on other aspects like economy and society overall. Therefore it is not possible and I don't want to judge on "better" or "worse" on any of the country strategies from an overall perspective. 
** KPI 2: Development of cumulated infections/deaths as a percentage of their population size
*** Purpose and Expectations
This KPI shall help to understand how far, and how fast the pandemic advanced in the five countries. 

From our analysis so far we might assume that 
+ Germany has the lowest overall rate of COVID-19 infections/deaths as well as the slowest further increase
+ Italy has the highest overall rate of COIVD-19 deaths and infections, but with a slower further increase
+ For the UK and the US we might see a similar development, with a rather rapidly growing percentage of COVID-19 infections and deaths.

*** Analysis and Results
**** Cumulated infections relative to populations size
[[./images/Fig12_CC_InfectionsCum.png]]

Overall, the relative number of infections is still far below 1% of the population in all five countries. Whereas the percentage in Sweden and Germany has grown to ~0.18%, the rate is already around 0.3% in Italy and the US. The UK is somehow in between with around 0.25%.

By end of April, the UK and the US have the steepest increase of relative infections, while Germany has the slowest. For Italy the curve is flattening and the US might soon pass by Italy in terms of infections relative to population size.

The development in Sweden was comparable moderate for a long period, but is continuing at a higher speed than e.g. Germany. Sweden might thus soon pass by Germany. 
**** Cumulated COVID-19 deaths relative to populations size
[[./images/Fig13_CC_DeathsCum.png]]

The cumulated, relative numbers of deaths show a surprisingly clear picture. Relative to its population size, Italy suffered most with more than 0.04% deaths by end of April. Germany is the only country with less than 0.01% death. The other three countries are in between. 

Also the relative growth rate in Germany is the lowest in the analyzed country group. 

*** Conclusions
Based on the available data, the COVID-19 pandemic has still only reached a relatively small percentage of the overall population. The number of reported infections is far below 0.5% in all analyzed countries. Even if the real figure of infections is multiple times above the officially reported number, the countries are far away from a sufficient level of infections (60% to 70%) which would stop the further progression of the pandemic.

The data indicates again significant differences between the analyzed countries. With regard to COVID-19 deaths for example, Italy suffered more than 4 times worth compared to Germany. Whatever the reasons are, it seems to be clearly worth to start further research to understand the root causes of these differences.
** KPI 3: Mortality Rate per country
*** Purpose and Expectations
By looking at the mortality rate we might be able to understand the hazardous nature of a COVID-19 infection. A high mortality rate would explain the significance of the COVID-19 mitigation measures that have been put in place by nearly all countries. In order to understand how mortality rates, we must compare the COVID-19 rate with other, past pandemics. According to [[https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-deadly-is-the-coronavirus-compared-to-past-outbreaks#1918-influenza][healthline.com]], we have the following death rates for past pandemics:

|-----------------------+-----------------|
| Past Pandemic         | Death Rate in % |
|-----------------------+-----------------|
| Spanish flu from 1918 |              2% |
| Seasonal flu          |            0.1% |
| SARS 2002-2004        |             15% |
| H1N1 2009             |           0.02% |
| Ebola 2014-2016       |             50% |
|-----------------------+-----------------|
| Estimated COVID-19    |            3.4% |
|-----------------------+-----------------|


Comparing the mortality rate between countries might provide further insights. E.g. about the stability and level of the respective national healthcare systems. 

Given the insights we have gained so far, we might assume that 
+ The mortality rate across all countries is at a quite high level
+ The mortality rate differs significantly between the countries. 
*** Analysis and Results
**** Mortality Rate per country as of April 29th
In the first analysis we will look at the mortality rate per country as of April 29th. The mortality rate in percentage is simply calculated as <total deaths> / <total infections> * 100.

[[./images/Fig14_CC_Mortality.png]]

Based on the available data, we have surprisingly high mortality rates in all countries. Sweden, UK and Italy are around 13%, whereas Germany is at 4% and the US is around 6%. These numbers are all much higher than the COVID-19 mortality rate estimated by the WHO (3.4%). The reason might be the expected high number of infections which are not officially reported and thus are not included in the numbers. On the other side, also not all COVID-19 deaths might be officially reported.
*** Conclusion
Based on the available data, the mortality rate of COVID-19 infections seems to be at least 30 to 40 times above the mortality rate of the regular seasonal flue and quite the double of the Spanish Flue from the early 1900th. The numbers might still be weak due to the quality and comprehensiveness of COVID-19 testing, but there is a clear tendency that COVID-19 is one of the most hazardous infections we have seen over the last centuries. Especially in combination with the possible exponential growth of infections, COVID-19 is extremely dangerous. The result of this assessment does well explain the significant level of restrictions that so many countries have put in place.
