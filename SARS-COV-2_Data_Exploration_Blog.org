* Introduction

Over the first few month in 2020, the Covid-19/Corona virus pandemic has put the entire world into a serious health, social and economic crisis. The pandemic has spread rapidly, and is still spreading rapidly, across all countries. Most countries have closed their borders and shut down their normal societal and economic life.

The Corona pandemic is omnipresent all over the world and many people are working hard to better understand 
1) How quickly the virus spreads across countries and societies,
2) What measures might have an impact on the infection and/or death growth rate, and
3) What the major implications of the virus pandemic will be. 

The insights resulting from such analysis could then be used by politicians and other authorities to take decisions, if and how to either loosen or intensify societal and economical restrictions.

*Over the course of this project we will analyze the following aspects:*

1. Which sources of trustful data around the Corona pandemic exists?
2. What kind of data is provided in the various sources and how can it be used to help understand, how fast the virus spreads in a specific country?
3. Are there significant differences between countries in how the pandemic develops? And what might be the reasons for these differences?
4. How do the number of Corona infections and Corona deaths correlate with each other? Are there significant differences between countries?
5. How can the implications of the Corona pandemic be measured by data?

* Part I: Sources of trustful data around the Corona pandemic

In order to understand the development of the pandemic, we need trustworthy data. The data should provide information on the number of new infections and new deaths per country on a daily basis. That kind of data would allow us to understand the growth rate of infections as well as of deaths caused by the Corona virus.

Some countries like [[https://info.gesundheitsministerium.at/][Austria]] or [[https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html][Germany]] do provide official dashboards to publish the number of Corona infections and deaths. For other countries there are different sources with slightly different figures. 

As we want to compare the pandemic development between different countries, it seems advisable to use a central data source which comprise data from all, or at least most countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides daily [[https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/][Situation Reports]] on their website. These situation reports are only available as PDF documents and thus difficult to process.

Another institution that collects and provides data about the Coronavirus desease is the "[[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en][European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]]" (ECDC), which is an agency of the European Union. The agency provides [[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide][downloadable data files]], which are updated daily and contain the latest available public data on COVID-19. According to [[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/copyright][ECDC's copyright policy]], the data /may be reproduced, adapted and/or distributed, totally or in part, irrespective of the means and/or the formats used, provided that ECDC is always acknowledged as the original source of the material. Such acknowledgement must be included in each copy of the material./ The ECDC is using the same data to produce a dashboard page called "[[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases][Situation Update Worldwide]]".

The ECDC has published its approach for collecting and processing COVID-19 data on [[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data-collection][this page]]. 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Every day between 6.00 and 10.00 CET, a team of epidemiologists screens up to 500 relevant sources to collect the latest figures. The data screening is followed by ECDC's standard epidemic intelligence process for which every single data entry is validated and documented in an ECDC database. An extract of this database, complete with up-to-date figures and data visualisations, is then shared on the ECDC website, ensuring a maximum level of transparency.
#+END_QUOTE 

The collection and processing approach of the ECDC as well as its copyright policy seems to be appropriate for the intended data analysis. Thus we will use the ECDC data set over the course of this project.

* Part II: Analysis of the provided data and how it can be used to help understand the dynamics of the pandemic
** Data contained in the daily updated and downloadable ECDC data set
The ECDC dataset can be downloaded as CSV file. Over the course of the project, I used datasets from different days. The final results are based on the data from April 29th. A first outline does show that the dataset contains 10 columns.

*** Statistics of the data set

[[./images/Fig02_DataStatistics.png]]


Overall, the raw dataset contains 13623 rows from 207 distinct countries. The earliest reporting is 31st of January 2019. The number of total infections up to April 28th is 2982688 and the number of total deaths is 210193. Based on this data, the current mortality rate is at 7%.


** How fast does the pandamic develop within a specific country?
After having identified a trustful data source about the development of infections and deaths, let's see how this data can be used to help understand how fast the virus spreads within a specific country. For this analysis we will exemplarily focus on Germany.

The following KPIs shall be evaluated to determine which KPI, or which combination of KPI's, is the best one to understand the speed of the pandemic spread:

*** 1. Number of new infections and deaths per day 
The number of new infections and new deaths is is directly provided in the ECDC data set. In order to visualize the development, we use a simple bar chart.


**** Number of new infections per day
[[./images/Fig03_Ger_NumberOfInfectionsPerDay.png]]

In Germany, the first infection was reported on January 28th. Based on the current numbers, we might seperate the pandemic currently into 4 phases:
+ Phase 1 (4-5 weeks): The number of new infections per day is quite stable at a very low level.
+ Phase 2 (1-2 weeks): The number of new infections is growing significantly, somehow exploding.
+ Phase 3 (3 weeks): The number of new infections varies per day, but seems to be stable overall at a quite high level.
+ Phase 4 (x weeks): The number of new infections declines slowly.

How the numbers will develop further and whether the trend of declining growth is sustainable, is currently not predictable.

**** Number of new deaths per day
[[./images/Fig04_Ger_NumberOfDeathsPerDay.png]]

In Germany, the first COVID-19 death was reported on March 10th, so around 6 weeks after the pandemic started in the country. So far, the highest number of new deaths was reported on April 16th with 315 deaths, which is approximately 4 weeks after the number of new infections has started to significantly increase.

*** 2. Cumulated number of infections and deaths over time

**** Cumulated number of infections

[[./images/Fig05_Ger_NumberOfInfectionsCum.png]]

As indicated by the bar chart of new infections above, the total number of infections remains relatively stable and low until mid of March, so approximately 5-6 weeks after the pandemic started. After this first phase, we can see a kind of exponential growth of infections for around 1-2 weeks, after which the curve flattens at the end of the reporting period.
**** Cumulated number of death

[[./images/Fig06_Ger_NumberOfDeathsCum.png]]

The cumulated number of deaths follows the number of infections with a few days of delay (approximately a week). 
*** 3. Temporal progressions of new infections and new deaths
The analysis so far does indicate that 
1. The pandemic - expressed by numbers of new infections per day - started slowly in a first phase, exploded somehow in a relatively short second phase, remained stable at a high level for around 3 weeks and then started to decline.
2. The number of deaths follows the number of infections with a certain delay. However, the decline of new death is - so far - not yet proven by the current numbers.

Let's look at this by normalizing each of the two data rows into a range of 0 to 1. That should provide a better visibility on how huge (or small) the increase of new infections / new deaths has been over time relative to the maximum (minimum) of new infections / new deaths.

[[./images/Fig07_Ger_NormalizedNumbers.png]]

The normalized numbers support the indication from above nicely. However, reliable predictions for the further development of new infections / new deaths are not possible based on the given date.

*** 3. "Growth Rate": Change Percentage growth of infections / deaths
  + Calcuated as {number of new cases on day x} / {cumulated number of cases up to day x} * 100
+ "Doubling Days": Number of days in which the number of cases doubles
  + Calculated as {cumulated cases up to day x} / {average number of cases over the last 5 days}
+ "Change of Growth Rate": Change rate of the "Growth Rate"
  + Calculated as {average growth rate of (day x-5 up to day x)} / {average growth rate of (day x-6 up to day x-1)}
